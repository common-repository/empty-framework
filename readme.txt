A truly responsive page builder and CSS generator for WordPress developers. 

== Description ==
A truly responsive page builder and CSS generator for WordPress developers.

empty offers a page builder to create layouts for different breakpoints and devices. It therefore uses individual responsive settings and generates corresponding clean CSS files which will be included in the frontend of your Wordpress theme.

Install empty and transform your WordPress installation into a fully responsive page builder and developer environment.
Start by adding breakpoints for the devices you want to target (eg. smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, …) which will be available in the page builder interface. You can customize any page layout for each breakpoint right in your WordPress backend. Create elements with different widths and positions for different viewports by simple resizing and dragging them in place.
empty then takes care of delivering those responsive layouts to the frontend. It writes clean HTML code with corresponding CSS classes and includes dynamically created CSS files with all @media tags in place.

Don't worry about setting up responsive content elements blind and without visual feedback in code anymore — do it visually right in your WordPress editor.
